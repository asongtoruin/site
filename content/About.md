# Hello!
I'm Adam. By day a transport planner, by night a self-taught amateur programmer.
In both situations I try and use Python as much as possible, though once I've
got a few projects out of the way (such as this site) I'm planning on
learning R.

This site is intended mostly as a place to detail the various projects I end up
working on for the handful of people who ask me how they're done. It's probably
not going to be super interesting or updated with any well-defined regularity,
but hopefully there might be something someone out there finds informative.

## This Site
As you may notice in the footer, this site is powered by
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and uses my own (slightly messy)
[fork](https://github.com/asongtoruin/hugo-theme-terminal) of
[panr](https://github.com/panr)'s excellent
[Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme. The landing page
for the site was largely adapted from
[luizdepra](https://github.com/luizdepra)'s
[Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme.
