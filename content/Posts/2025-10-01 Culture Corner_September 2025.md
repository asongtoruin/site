## FILMS
**The Naked Gun**: a slightly overwhelming film (the jokes are _relentless_) made even stranger by watching it in the cinema at 9am on a Sunday. I love a morning film at the weekend though, and simply will not be stopped.

## MUSIC
**King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard (again)**: so after I mentioned getting into King Gizzard last month, on the 10th of September they decided to make all of their albums [pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp](https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/). So I went from having five of their albums to, uh, _nineteen_. I'm not sure they're quite as genre-hopping as some of their fans would like to make them out to be, but there truly is a wild range of styles across their various albums - nice new discoveries for me being the synth-heavy _Butterfly 3000_, bluesy groovy _Fishing for Fishies_ and the country-tinged _Flight b741_.

**Man's Best Friend by Sabrina Carpenter**: It might be a little incongruous with the rest of my music tastes, but I quite like pop music. Crucially though, I want my pop music to be absolutely _pop_ - I'm not big on a pop ballad, or when something gets a little too close to other styles of music I enjoy (Folklore, I'm looking at you.) Sabrina Carpenter's new album, then, absolutely hits the spot for me - it's absolute _pop_, it's fun, and the lyrics are truly _something_.

## GAMES
**Date Everything**: Cara and I started playing this weird dating sim where you basically have to flirt with inanimate objects around your house. It is absolutely bizarre, but very silly and fun.

## BOOKS
**Slow Horses**: Why would you put an entire series of 8 books on sale _apart from_ the 4th one? Very unreasonable to me. But I fairly quickly went through the first book - an entertaining little espionage-y thriller.
