## FILMS
**Better Man**: Hollywood paid probably literally thousands of pounds to CGI a monkey into the classic Vale Kalamazoo home shirt, and I just think that's neat (it's a pretty good film too).

## MUSIC
**King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard**: Not sure entirely why I chose to give King Gizzard another go - I'd listened to them briefly a while ago and didn't really think much of it. Something clicked this time though - turns out I am actually quite partial to their proggy-garage rock. Nonagon Infinity has very quickly become one of the few albums I'll actually run to - there's a really nice rhythm to it. With as many albums as they have (27???) it's going to take me a long while to dig through, but I'm enjoying what I've heard so far.

**Brent Hinds**: I'm fairly sure it was 2005 by the time my dad and I bought 2004's now classic Mastodon album Leviathan. We were definitely fully on board before 2006's Blood Mountain, which for a long while was one of my favourite albums. Mastodon were one of the first prog-tinged bands I got into, which could probably be thought of as one of the first steps along the road for me becoming a math rock nerd. Brent's guitar playing was a huge part of that - the stylistic flourishes and embellishments adding to their thrashy core. More than that, they were a band who could mix between taking themselves seriously (multiple concept albums) and being distinctly goofy (most of their merch, Bladecatcher existing as a song) - Brent's [faux-pharmaceutical advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wy_mXuEsP0) remains an absolute favourite of my dad and I. Even though I've moved onto different music and Brent left Mastodon earlier this year, I found myself revisiting those early Mastodon albums after hearing of Brent's death and remembering just how good they are. The world's a less weird place without Brent in it, and that's a shame for everyone.

## ArcTanGent
Okay guess what - it's another festival that I don't think it's right to keep restricted to the Music section alone. ATG might have started as 2000 Trees' weird sibling, but I just so happen to be the weird sibling in _my_ family, so it was always going to be my thing. Eleven iterations in I'm yet to miss one, and we're highly likely to hit twelve next year. ATG is the kind of festival where even the first bands on of the day will play to a decently-sized crowd, niche bands get a huge response, and there seem to be very few people acting like arseholes. The highlights for me, then:

**clown core**: When clown core were announced for ArcTanGent last year, I gave them a little listen to see what they were all about. On the first listen I thought it was a bit weird, and then subsequently got completely obsessed with them. I was gutted that they had to pull out last year, and was thrilled when they were announced again for this year instead (and nothing got in the way this time). An utterly bizarre but thrilling experience - two guys dressed as clowns, not moving for the first 5 minutes of their set, the tiniest drumkit you've ever seen, absolutely unhinged AI art in the background. The only thing detracting from finally being able to see them was the absence of absolute angel boy Cam (he has a new baby to look after, it's fair enough). 

**Karnivool**: When Karnivool were announced for ArcTanGent last year, I gave them a little listen to see what they were all about. On the first listen I thought it was a bit underwhelming, and then subsequently got completely obsessed with them. Yeah, turns out James Scarlett knows what he's doing when he books ATG. Among the most fun ATG headliners in years, I had a lovely singalong with my pals.

**The Fall of Troy**: Doppelganger in full, 16 year old me would have been _so stoked_.

**Snooze**: I wrote about their new album _I KNOW HOW YOU WILL DIE_ back in May - it remains in heavy rotation for me, and it was extremely fun to see some of those songs live. I just wish it had been a longer set.

**Ithaca**: Back in February I travelled to London for Ithaca's final show, only for them to announce a set at ATG as part of their encore. I don't mind it at all - this was maybe the best sound I've ever seen them have, a packed-out tent and a band clearly very emotional to be there. They'll be missed.

**Melvins**: Not a band I've ever listened to much on record, but an unexpectedly fantastic live set - the kind of music that made me either want to walk at an aggressively fast place, or be playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

## GAMES
**Hollow Knight**: Silksong is real????? Okay, I guess I'd better retry Hollow Knight and see if I can actually get through Deepnest this time.

## BOOKS
**Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir**: good good good.
