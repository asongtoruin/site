## TV
**Mad Men**: In my 30-something years on earth, smoking isn't something I've ever done. Not even once. The smell of cigarettes occasionally gives me a strong hit of nostalgia (gig venues pre-smoking ban, old blokes smoking terrible roll-ups at night games at Vale Park) but never enough to make me at all interested in considering it myself. And yet somehow, watching Mad Men makes me want to smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey.

## MUSIC
**Killswitch Engage**: I wasn't expecting to be seeing Killswitch in 2025, but when I found out my pal Jo had a metalcore phase we agreed to go to their next tour. It was an added little treat for teenage Adam that Hatebreed supported them (I Will Be Heard will eternally make me feel like I could run through a wall, starting on it is just _cheating_), and it's nice to say I've now seen both Jesse and Howard singing for Killswitch. The melodies are still impeccable with either one doing them.

**Joyce Manor**: Maybe my favourite live band of all time? I was stood calmly in the middle of the crowd for about 1.25 songs until I got too annoyed at the people around me stood almost completely still and ran into the pit, on the edge of which I stayed for the rest of the show. I came away with two bruised elbows, one crowdsurfed friend (Beth, I will always send you over) and a happy heart.

## BOOKS
**Raw Dog**: Hot dogs are great eh? This is a travelogue about hot dogs, but is also about America during COVID, and terible labour practices, and going through a break-up. It's fantastic.
