## FILMS 


## TV
**Grand Designs**: nothing like being ill for several days to make me yearn for Kevin nodding politely while some bloke insists they won't compromise on their budget, timescale or scope (and then ends up doing so on all three). 

**Fallout**: I tried to play Fallout 3 a long, long time ago but didn't get far because it got too stressful fast. But now there's a TV show with all the vibes but I can turn away if it's too weird for me? Ideal, really.

## MUSIC
**Origami Angel**: absolutely rude that the two shows I went to didn't get Pok√©mon Emerald speedrun footage as a background, but hot damn that's a fun live band. 

**I'm Scared That's All There Is by Ben Quad**: near-perfect gang vocal mathy emo. Slightly sad their more recent EP is a bit heavier, but maybe they'll go back to this again.
