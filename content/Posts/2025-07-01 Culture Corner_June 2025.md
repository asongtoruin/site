## TV
**Taskmaster**: we were pretty late to the Taskmaster game (and only started it in 2022), ended up absolutely blasting through the first 14 seasons and getting a little tired of it (those COVID seasons really were sub-par). After a bit of a break we're back into season 15 and I am fully a Taskmaster convert once again, I now understand the appeal of Ivo Graham and Jenny Eclair's presence is a lovely reminder of a youth spent listening to Radio 4 comedy (I was a wild child).

## PODCASTS
**Hot Money Season 2 - The New Narcos**: for someone who _actively avoided a career in finance_ after finishing a maths degree, I sure do like stories of dubious financial goings-on. The first season of Hot Money was about the finances of the porn industry - I listened to it a few years back (and found it very interesting), but only recently remembered they did some other series about different topics.
