## TV
**Race Across The World**: as a fussy vegetarian eater and an anxious traveller, I am unlikely to travel especially widely in the world. Race Across The World sounds like it would be my actual nightmare to participate in, but it's an ideal show for me to watch. There's light drama _and_ occasionally heart-warming tales _and_ you get to see cool and interesting bits of the world.

**Silo**: I read the entire Silo series a few years back, but forgot just how much I enjoyed it until we started watching the series and I was overjoyed to find things actually looking like how I'd pictured them. We're not too far into the series yet, but it's fun so far.

## MUSIC
**I KNOW HOW YOU WILL DIE by Snooze**: despite the slightly edgy title, this is actually an absolutely incredible slice of mathy proggy occasionally-blastbeaty singalong goodness. My good pal Aaron described it as "like every ArcTanGent band playing at once" and I think that's pretty accurate (and probably why I enjoy it so much). This feels likely to trouble my Album of the Year list come December.

**Totorro**: being asked what kind of music I listen to is always a bit of a tricky one - I love variety, and can often find _something_ to enjoy in many different genres. That being said, if you wanted to know the kind of thing I'm most likely to enjoy - Totorro are pretty much exactly Adam-targeted music. Math rock, major chords, mostly intrumental, good riffs. This month we went all the way to Leeds to see them on their first UK tour since 2017 (!) in a tiny room, and it's the most I've smiled at a gig in a long time. What a band.

**The Bossa Beyond channel on SomaFM**: I'm not a radio person in the main, or a playlist person most of the time. I like the idea of an album providing an order to things, knowing what's coming next adding to my enjoyment of what I'm listening to and a sense of the kind of flow the artist intended. This month, though, I've been listening to [SomaFM](https://somafm.com/) a lot - it's a collection of ad-free and interesting internet radio stations for different genres, and it's been quite nice to put something new on as background noise when I'm working or reading or just pottering about the flat. _Groove Salad's_ laid-back electronica has been on a fair amount, but it's the Brazilian-ish _Bossa Beyond_ channel that I've really been enjoying - things I wouldn't even know how to discover otherwise, but that I can tap my foot to without getting too distracted by. Is this my version of _lofi hip hop radio beats to relax/study to_? Probably.

## GAMES
**Vampire Survivors**: ...yeah so I got back into Vampire Survivors so badly I had to uninstall it from my Switch. It's dangerous.
