## TV
**Severance**: it took the renaming of a group chat and some substantial nagging from friends but yes, we are now fully invested in Severance. It's a little too stressful to completely blast through, but we got through season one at a fair pace. Lots to think about, but mainly how much I want one of the MDR keyboards.


## BOOKS
**The Last Murder At The End Of The World by Stuart Turton**:  listening to this, I discovered the limit I have when it comes to the "performance" element of audiobooks - it's just a touch too theatrical for me. The book itself is OK - some good spots but also a few weird lulls.

**Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky**: I absolutely devoured this, another audiobook. A really cool premise (moon-sized aliens destroying planets by reshaping them into artistic forms), interesting characters and a decent pace. This basically became my background audio whenever I needed some (going for a walk, doing chores etc). Excited to listen to the rest of the series.


## GAMES
**Pokémon Emerald**: does it feel weird that a game I remember being released is now considered "retro"? Yes, yes it does. I didn't play this when it first came out (I was very much a Sapphire boy) so it's fun to take a little trip back to give it a go. Unfortunately I think I've been spoiled a bit but some of the "quality of life" improvements from a recent playthrough of Pokémon Unbound, because _what do you mean my bag has a size limit_??? I'm still a sucker for GBA-era Pokémon though.


## MISCELLANEOUS
**Atkinson Hyperlegible**: is this culture? I don't know, but also it's my website so I guess I can do what I want. I like a nice font from time to time, and stumbled upon the [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/) font family while reading about some Linux stuff. It's a set of fonts designed to be legible and readable to people with low vision, but also it's just very pleasant to look at. I've set it as my desktop font and my ereader font (the latter particularly useful for reading without my glasses on before bed), and I might see how this site looks with the monospace variant soon.
