# What?
Some friends of mine run the excellent [Bi History](<https://www.instagram.com/bihistory/>)
Instagram account that provides useful information and resources about 
bisexuality. I've been trying to think of a way I could produce some nice graphs
for them, but sadly there seems to be a dearth of good, reliable data sources on 
this topic. There is, however, an ONS survey on "Sexual Orientation" that 
provides estimates of the UK's LGB population across various classifications.
The sections offering the most interesting and "reliable" (ONS' definition, not 
mine) populations for bisexuality were the total UK population by year, and the 
population by age group for the latest available year of 2018.

# How?
As with a lot of my graphs recently this is just a well-labelled bar plot, but
there were a few new `matplotlib` features for me here. 

Adding the watermark for the account required use of [`fig.figimage`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figimage.html) 
and making sure it stayed in the correct position between drawing and saving 
required setting `plt.rcParams['figure.dpi']` to the same as our output DPI.

Additionally, I used a [`LinearSegmentedColourmap`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.html)
in two separate places. First, to colour the bars with the bisexual flag colours
(which look absolutely lovely here), and secondly to set our supporting colours.
The background colour is a very lightened form of the pink of the flag, and the 
text is a darkened form. I think this gives it some nice aesthetic consistency.

For a bit of extra fun, while prototyping the yearly graph I saved it with a 
full time and date stamp at each stage (the age group graph largely used the 
same code so this is much less interesting). This lets us see the full 
development of this graph, from as basic bar chart to our final image.
