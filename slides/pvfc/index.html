<p>My experiences as a Port Vale fan since 1997</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-first-match">The first match</h3>
<p>My first Vale match took place on the 9th September 1997. A dark Tuesday night
in the Railway Stand at Vale Park with my sister and uncle, where I spent most
of the evening covering my ears because &ldquo;the crowd was too loud&rdquo; (if only the
same was true today).</p>
</section><section>
<p>One reason for that could have been that Lee Mills scored twice as Vale
overturned Stockport County 2-1, giving me the false impression that Vale were a
team who won football matches.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="the-first-kit">The first kit</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the first Vale kit I received, but it may well have been the
one that I still remember most fondly.</p>
</section><section>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The 1996-1998 away kit, sponsored by Tunstall Assurance and split beautifully
into four quadrants of black and golden yellow. I spent hours upon hours in my
parents&rsquo; garden <em>in the full kit</em> imagining I was firing in screamers in front
of a packed Bycars.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
</section><section>
<p>Being a Vale fan leads to its fair share of rough times. As the club who have
played the most seasons in English League football without ever having been in
the top flight (citation needed) this has been true historically, but my time as
a fan has seen:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Three relegations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two instances of the club going into administration.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One club captain suspended for racist language <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the club’s designated anti-racism day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</section><section>
<p>In typical Vale fashion, the second of those relegations coincided with our
local rivals Stoke City being promoted to the Premier League.</p>

</section>

<section data-shortcode-section>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
</section><section>
<p>Amongst it all though there is some fun to be had being a Vale fan, with four
occasions sticking out more than the others. In chronological order&hellip;</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="john-rudge">John Rudge</h3>
<p>John Rudge is, in my opinion, amongst the most underrated football managers
possibly of all time. Under his 16-year stewardship, the club jumped two
divisions and played some of the best football seen in Burslem. He was
instantly recognisable from the flat cap he wore on the touchline.</p>
</section><section>
<p>As a Vale-obsessed child, I drew a picture of John celebrating the team escaping
relegation on the last day of the season, throwing his flat cap into the air.</p>
<p>My auntie decided we&rsquo;d take this to the club to leave for Rudgie.</p>
</section><section>
<p>One day during the school holidays, we did just that. My auntie asked at
reception if we could leave the drawing there for him, and the receptionist
instead invited us to take it to him ourselves.</p>
</section><section>
<p>So there I was, sat across the desk from our manager and folk hero. He accepted
the drawing graciously, and was asking me about my thoughts on football and how
I was doing in school.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The phone on his desk rang.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I froze.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->He turned to his assistant, and simply said<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</section><section>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you get that and tell them I&rsquo;m busy</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section>
<p>To this day, this stays with me as among the most thrilling things to have
happened to me. For all we knew that call was Ronaldo (original version only)
telling him he wanted to sign for the Vale, but Rudgie was busy <em>talking to me</em>.</p>
</section><section>
<p>When Rudge was ultimately fired by the club (and our controversial owner), there
was a flat cap march through the town in protest.</p>
<p>Sir Alex Ferguson is quoted at this time as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every Port Vale supporter should get down on their knees and thank The Lord for John Rudge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think I can agree with that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h3 id="the-ldv-vans-trophy">The LDV Vans Trophy</h3>
<p>Somehow, in 2001 we made it past the first round of a trophy competition. More
miraculously still, we actually made it to the final of the LDV Vans Trophy</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->…which would take place on the day of my tenth birthday.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</section><section>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a night almost completely devoid of sleep for me, and by extension most of
our household (sorry dad) we took a minibus trip to Cardiff and a meeting with
Brentford at the Millennium Stadium.</p>
<p>Going 1-0 down within the first 5 minutes wasn&rsquo;t ideal but, inspired by the
anniversary of my birth, Vale managed to pull it back to win 2-1 and go back to
the Potteries with our first trophy since 1993.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="2012-2013-league-two-season">2012-2013 League Two Season</h3>
<p>In the 2012-2013 season, with two games left to go Vale were on the verge of
promotion. The penultimate game of the season was at home against Northampton
in front of a sell-out crowd (unheard of) that we needed to win to be certain
of promotion.</p>
</section><section>
<p>Of course, Vale being Vale, that meant that with 5 minutes to go, we were 2-1
down and struggling to break down a robust Northampton defence.</p>
</section><section>
<p>A hopeful ball forwards from the halfway line didn&rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere,
until former Valiant (and current Northampton centre-half) Lee Collins slid in
to intercept and accidentally(?) hooked the ball over his helpless keeper.</p>
<p>Even though we didn&rsquo;t win, other results went our way to leave us only an
unrealistic swing in goals away from promotion (which didn&rsquo;t happen).</p>
</section><section>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We were rather happy about it.</p>
</section><section>
<h3 id="2019-2020-fa-cup">2019-2020 FA Cup</h3>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor achievement but, well, we take
the small victories.</p>
<p>In the third round of the FA Cup we were drawn away against reigning champions
Manchester City. Our full allocation of 7000 tickets sold out immediately, and
the away tier was packed long before kick-off.</p>
</section><section>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was slightly larger than we were used to.</p>
</section><section>
<p>Coming into the match feeling realistic about our prospects against even a youth
team, I was horrified to see Man City putting out a surprisingly strong team.</p>
<p>Though we ultimately lost comfortably and the score was never in any doubt, the
Vale fans never stopped singing throughout (in contrast to the deathly silence
of the home fans) and ultimately we had one magical moment because&hellip;</p>
</section><section>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&hellip;well, if you feed the Pope he <strong>will</strong> score.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic">The Magic</h2>
</section><section>
<p>Ultimately, supporting a lower-league team isn&rsquo;t filled with glory. There are
lots of times where it&rsquo;s frustrating or saddening.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But also there’s the magic.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</section><section>
<p>One of the unexpected joys of football is in the routines. Living far away from
the club I support makes this all the more obvious. Every time I&rsquo;m home we go
through the same routine.</p>
</section><section>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The pub beforehand.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shaking hands with the regulars who sit near us as we take our seats.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mini bars of chocolate from my auntie at half time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

</section><section>
<p>There are objectively &ldquo;better&rdquo; football clubs, clubs with better fanbases, clubs
with nicer stadiums, clubs who are probably <em>easier</em> to support.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there’s only one Port Vale, and that’s the club for me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
