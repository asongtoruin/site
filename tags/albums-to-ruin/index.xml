      <description>Introduction This post is a continuation of the development of my Albums to Ruin Twitter bot. This is the first part of actual development of the bot - information on the concept and outline can be found in the Initial Concept post.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover the database operations required to power the Twitter bot and keep track of what has already been posted and the queue of albums to post.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is a continuation of the development of my Albums to Ruin Twitter bot. This is the first part of actual development of the bot - information on the concept and outline can be found in the Initial Concept post.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover the process required for getting the recently played tracks from Spotify and the URL for the album art.
Getting Started First of all, we need to register an application with Spotify.</description>

      <title>Albums to Ruin: Initial Concept</title>

      <description>Inspiration Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few posts shared around from the Instagram account colorpalette.cinema. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of a nice colour palette (indeed, a few years ago I had a Twitter bot running that did something similar with Marvel comics covers) and it got me thinking about whether I could do something similar of my own.
The idea, and an initial outline As you might have guessed from the post title, my plan is to make something similar for album covers.</description>
