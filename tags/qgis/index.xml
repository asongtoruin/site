      <description>&lt;p&gt;After making my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/graphs/2021-03-23-pub-names/&#34;&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; about the most common pub names in each country in Great Britain, one thing that really stood out was just how many pubs in England are called &lt;em&gt;Red Lion&lt;/em&gt;. Being from the Midlands that made a lot of sense to me, but a few people who I showed it to seemed quite surprised. That got me thinking about what kind of regional variation there is in pub names. So, why not look at the most popular pub names by county?
