      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GitHub Actions on a few different&#xA;projects for building documentation and executables. The direct integration into&#xA;GitHub makes it a bit more convenient than Travis, and being able to use&#xA;predefined Actions makes simple processes way easier to set up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, one thing I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed until recently was that you can trigger&#xA;workflows to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events&#34;&gt;on a schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This is an extremely powerful feature that, to me, seems under-publicised. My&#xA;first idea was that gives us the option of setting up auto-updating graphs - so&#xA;I decided to try that out with UK Covid-19 vaccination data. You can see the&#xA;results of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/graphs/2021-01-21-covid-19-vaccinations/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;but in this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through the (fairly straightforward) set-up I&#xA;used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in my day job recently has&#xA;involved taking over the development of a tool that implements some simple data&#xA;anonymisation. This includes the deployment of an executable that can be used by&#xA;non-technical staff, who will likely be the main users of the tool. It&amp;rsquo;s also&#xA;highly likely that all of those staff will be working on Windows PCs. As the&#xA;executable is created through PyInstaller, this means the executable needs to&#xA;be built in a Windows environment. Initially, I&amp;rsquo;d just been doing this locally&#xA;on my PC to create the executable for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
