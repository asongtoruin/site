      <description>Part of one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in my day job recently has involved taking over the development of a tool that implements some simple data anonymisation. This includes the deployment of an executable that can be used by non-technical staff, who will likely be the main users of the tool. It&amp;rsquo;s also highly likely that all of those staff will be working on Windows PCs. As the executable is created through PyInstaller, this means the executable needs to be built in a Windows environment.</description>
