  <div class="post-content">
    

<p>Back in the heady days of 2008, Oxford&rsquo;s finest math-rock band TTNG (back then
still known as This Town Needs Guns) opened their
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2217d2VN6Nn3zzU9mlApdK?si=nfr6tlwHQfKoMAmIfsSrtQ">self-titled release</a>
with a (fantastic) song providing a rather curious declaration -
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2g14gU0ZxGZ3Te9EjFsT25?si=efWS3BTTQziLPyavvecTcw"><em>26 Is Dancier Than 4</em></a>.</p>

<p>Jump forward 12 years to 2020, and I&rsquo;ve been digging around a bit in the Spotify
API to better understand what data it provides and try to find some fun things
to plot. In doing so, I spotted (geddit?) that within the object model, every
track has a series of attributes, one of which is called <em>danceability</em>.</p>

<p><em>Danceability</em>. Such an unknowable concept has been distilled down by Spotify to
a single number between 0 and 1. If you&rsquo;re anything like me, this concept
immediately brought up the idea that we&rsquo;d use this to verify the statement
provided by TTNG, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is 26 dancier than 4?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, alas, Spotify doesn&rsquo;t provide the <em>danceability</em> analysis for numbers
alone, only songs. So instead, we can ask a slightly different question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How danceable is <em>26 Is Dancier Than 4</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this a strangely convoluted excuse to make some graphs? Sure. Just go with me
on this one.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-does-the-number-mean">But what does the number <em>mean</em>?</h2>

<p>Right okay. We should probably have at least some sense of how the
<em>danceability</em> value is calculated. Fortunately, Spotify provides one in its
<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This differs somewhat from my own stance on what makes a song danceable (stable
rhythms are for cowards) but this is what we have to work with.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s look at how <em>26 Is Dancier Than 4</em> compares to other tracks on
<em>This Town Needs Guns</em>.</p>


  <div class="img-outer">
    <a href="https://ruszkow.ski/img/posts/ttng/ttng-album-danceability.png" target="_blank">
      <img class="scaled-img" src="https://ruszkow.ski/img/posts/ttng/ttng-album-danceability.png">
    </a>
  </div>



<p>Oh. So, it appears that <em>26 Is Dancier Than 4</em> is not very danceable. Moreover,
there are several more danceable tracks on this release alone. Maybe instead we
should try to find the most danceable TTNG track. But as I mentioned earlier,
I don&rsquo;t think Spotify&rsquo;s rating of <em>danceability</em> quite works for me, so I think
we should look at another attribute Spotify assigns to each track - <em>energy</em>.
This is defined by Spotify as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That feels a bit more like it. High energy would make me want to dance. Let&rsquo;s
instead plot the <em>danceability</em> and <em>energy</em> of every TTNG song. I&rsquo;ve added
labels to the tracks with the highest and lowest rating for each measure.</p>


  <div class="img-outer">
    <a href="https://ruszkow.ski/img/posts/ttng/ttng-dance-energy.png" target="_blank">
      <img class="scaled-img" src="https://ruszkow.ski/img/posts/ttng/ttng-dance-energy.png">
    </a>
  </div>



<p>Now this is a little more interesting - <em>26 Is Dancier Than 4</em>&rsquo;s high energy
makes up somewhat for its low <em>danceability</em>. It&rsquo;s interesting to see that all
of our extremes come from the same release (2008&rsquo;s stellar
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7n8f4VpR5BAC9IiLiiIWKl?si=Pva3JpmkRtK_5staUpEKKQ">Animals</a>)
and that TTNG&rsquo;s songs are generally high-energy (that definitely checks out).</p>

<p>What conclusions can we draw from this though? I&rsquo;ll give you two. Firstly, if we
just use our most extreme values then we can safely declare that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zebra Is Dancier Than Quetzal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, I&rsquo;ll be honest, has a fairly nice ring to it. One other thing that we
can read off this graph that also fits my desire for high <em>energy</em> to dance
gives us something much more fun to use though. May I instead provide my own
curious declaration:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Panda Is Dancier Than 26 Is Dancier Than 4</p>
</blockquote>
