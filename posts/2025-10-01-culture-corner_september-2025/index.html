MUSIC King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard (again): so after I mentioned getting into King Gizzard last month, on the 10th of September they decided to make all of their albums pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp. So I went from having five of their albums to, uh, nineteen. I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re quite as genre-hopping as some of their fans would like to make them out to be, but there truly is a wild range of styles across their various albums - nice new discoveries for me being the synth-heavy Butterfly 3000, bluesy groovy Fishing for Fishies and the country-tinged Flight b741.

    <h2 id="films">FILMS</h2>
<p><strong>The Naked Gun</strong>: a slightly overwhelming film (the jokes are <em>relentless</em>) made even stranger by watching it in the cinema at 9am on a Sunday. I love a morning film at the weekend though, and simply will not be stopped.</p>
<h2 id="music">MUSIC</h2>
<p><strong>King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard (again)</strong>: so after I mentioned getting into King Gizzard last month, on the 10th of September they decided to make all of their albums <a href="https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/">pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp</a>. So I went from having five of their albums to, uh, <em>nineteen</em>. I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re quite as genre-hopping as some of their fans would like to make them out to be, but there truly is a wild range of styles across their various albums - nice new discoveries for me being the synth-heavy <em>Butterfly 3000</em>, bluesy groovy <em>Fishing for Fishies</em> and the country-tinged <em>Flight b741</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Man&rsquo;s Best Friend by Sabrina Carpenter</strong>: It might be a little incongruous with the rest of my music tastes, but I quite like pop music. Crucially though, I want my pop music to be absolutely <em>pop</em> - I&rsquo;m not big on a pop ballad, or when something gets a little too close to other styles of music I enjoy (Folklore, I&rsquo;m looking at you.) Sabrina Carpenter&rsquo;s new album, then, absolutely hits the spot for me - it&rsquo;s absolute <em>pop</em>, it&rsquo;s fun, and the lyrics are truly <em>something</em>.</p>
<h2 id="games">GAMES</h2>
<p><strong>Date Everything</strong>: Cara and I started playing this weird dating sim where you basically have to flirt with inanimate objects around your house. It is absolutely bizarre, but very silly and fun.</p>
<h2 id="books">BOOKS</h2>
<p><strong>Slow Horses</strong>: Why would you put an entire series of 8 books on sale <em>apart from</em> the 4th one? Very silly to me. But I fairly quickly went through the first book - a fun little espionage-y thriller.</p>
