      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnstile&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can remember the last time I was at a &lt;em&gt;big gig&lt;/em&gt; where it felt like the whole room was moving but my word this was frantic. Moderately stressed for the bloke who almost immediately stacked it in the pit and bounced his head off my knee, but he seemed mostly fine. I had a big yell and a dance with my pals and it was very cathartic and joyful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mad Men&lt;/strong&gt;: In my 30-something years on earth, smoking isn&amp;rsquo;t something I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done. Not even once. The smell of cigarettes occasionally gives me a strong hit of nostalgia (gig venues pre-smoking ban, old blokes smoking terrible roll-ups at night games at Vale Park) but never enough to make me at all interested in considering it myself. And yet somehow, watching Mad Men makes me want to smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;films&#34;&gt;FILMS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Naked Gun&lt;/strong&gt;: a slightly overwhelming film (the jokes are &lt;em&gt;relentless&lt;/em&gt;) made even stranger by watching it in the cinema at 9am on a Sunday. I love a morning film at the weekend though, and simply will not be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King Gizzard &amp;amp; The Lizard Wizard (again)&lt;/strong&gt;: so after I mentioned getting into King Gizzard last month, on the 10th of September they decided to make all of their albums &lt;a href=&#34;https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;. So I went from having five of their albums to, uh, &lt;em&gt;nineteen&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure they&amp;rsquo;re quite as genre-hopping as some of their fans would like to make them out to be, but there truly is a wild range of styles across their various albums - nice new discoveries for me being the synth-heavy &lt;em&gt;Butterfly 3000&lt;/em&gt;, bluesy groovy &lt;em&gt;Fishing for Fishies&lt;/em&gt; and the country-tinged &lt;em&gt;Flight b741&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;films&#34;&gt;FILMS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Man&lt;/strong&gt;: Hollywood paid probably literally thousands of pounds to CGI a monkey into the classic Vale Kalamazoo home shirt, and I just think that&amp;rsquo;s neat (it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good film too).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King Gizzard &amp;amp; The Lizard Wizard&lt;/strong&gt;: Not sure entirely why I chose to give King Gizzard another go - I&amp;rsquo;d listened to them briefly a while ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t really think much of it. Something clicked this time though - turns out I am actually quite partial to their proggy-garage rock. Nonagon Infinity has very quickly become one of the few albums I&amp;rsquo;ll actually run to - there&amp;rsquo;s a really nice rhythm to it. With as many albums as they have (27???) it&amp;rsquo;s going to take me a long while to dig through, but I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;films&#34;&gt;FILMS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Cheerleaders Die&lt;/strong&gt;: when I asked my friend Alice back in April if I could crash at hers for a night to break up the journey to Cheltenham for 2000 Trees, she &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; picked the film that we would watch together. I think it says a lot about our friendship that a full &lt;em&gt;three months in advance&lt;/em&gt; she already knew what the mood of the evening should be. This was absolutely terrible; I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taskmaster&lt;/strong&gt;: we were pretty late to the Taskmaster game (and only started it in 2022), ended up absolutely blasting through the first 14 seasons and getting a little tired of it (those COVID seasons really were sub-par). After a bit of a break we&amp;rsquo;re back into season 15 and I am fully a Taskmaster convert once again, I now understand the appeal of Ivo Graham and Jenny Eclair&amp;rsquo;s presence is a lovely reminder of a youth spent listening to Radio 4 comedy (I was a wild child).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race Across The World&lt;/strong&gt;: as a fussy vegetarian eater and an anxious traveller, I am unlikely to travel especially widely in the world. Race Across The World sounds like it would be my actual nightmare to participate in, but it&amp;rsquo;s an ideal show for me to watch. There&amp;rsquo;s light drama &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; occasionally heart-warming tales &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you get to see cool and interesting bits of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silo&lt;/strong&gt;: I read the entire Silo series a few years back, but forgot just how much I enjoyed it until we started watching the series and I was overjoyed to find things actually looking like how I&amp;rsquo;d pictured them. We&amp;rsquo;re not too far into the series yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;films&#34;&gt;FILMS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Real Pain&lt;/strong&gt;: reminded me how much I miss my Polish grandmother, one of the best people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;: an absolute nonsense show but always entertaining. We&amp;rsquo;re just over half way through, and there is no way I could&amp;rsquo;ve guessed the turns it would take to get here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;MUSIC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lonely People With Power by Deafheaven&lt;/strong&gt;: hot damn, blastbeats are so back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manning Fireworks by MJ Lenderman&lt;/strong&gt;: I regret missing out on tickets for his Glasgow show, every time I listen to this album I find a new little bit to appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severance&lt;/strong&gt;: it took the renaming of a group chat and some substantial nagging from friends but yes, we are now fully invested in Severance. It&amp;rsquo;s a little too stressful to completely blast through, but we got through season one at a fair pace. Lots to think about, but mainly how much I want one of the MDR keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;BOOKS&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last Murder At The End Of The World by Stuart Turton&lt;/strong&gt;:  listening to this, I discovered the limit I have when it comes to the &amp;ldquo;performance&amp;rdquo; element of audiobooks - it&amp;rsquo;s just a touch too theatrical for me. The book itself is OK - some good spots but also a few weird lulls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv&#34;&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grand Designs&lt;/strong&gt;: nothing like being ill for several days to make me yearn for Kevin nodding politely while some bloke insists they won&amp;rsquo;t compromise on their budget, timescale or scope (and then ends up doing so on all three).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fallout&lt;/strong&gt;: I tried to play Fallout 3 a long, long time ago but didn&amp;rsquo;t get far because it got too stressful fast. But now there&amp;rsquo;s a TV show with all the vibes but I can turn away if it&amp;rsquo;s too weird for me? Ideal, really.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realise I&amp;rsquo;ve basically not been doing anything with this website and that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a waste. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m not finding a huge amount of time or motivation to work on personal projects so I need to find something else to fill the space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The slow death of Twitter dot com has left me with a relative lack of places to express my Thoughts on things I enjoy (or don&amp;rsquo;t), so I think what I might try and do is some kind of monthly dump of my thoughts on stuff. Yeah, you can get some of this from Letterboxd or StoryGraph but this might be more interim thoughts (and I get to say things about music). Okay? Okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;where-have-you-been-thanks-manchester-orchestra&#34;&gt;Where Have You Been? (thanks Manchester Orchestra)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a particularly prolonged busy period of work of&amp;hellip; a year or so? Maybe longer? At this point, honestly who can even understand the passage of time any more. Anyway, that seems to have come to and end for now so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to reclaim my evenings and start actually finishing work on time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of that (and with a bit more mental bandwidth to spare after I log off), I&amp;rsquo;m trying to pick up some new projects and get back into the routine of doing some programming for fun rather than just for work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Album of the Year 2021</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year, top champ &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/philipcopley&#34;&gt;Pip&lt;/a&gt; runs a Facebook group to work out the Album Of The Year within an extended friendship group. For the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been making graphs to summarise the results, using some slightly clunky Jupyter notebooks. At first this just analysed the albums chosen by the group, and then last year (after I did my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/posts/2020-11-17-dance-dancier-danciest/&#34;&gt;TTNG analysis&lt;/a&gt;) I expanded it to include some Spotify data too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of the charts for each year can be found on Github &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/asongtoruin/AOTY&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I find myself gradually tweaking (and hopefully improving!) the code each year, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a bit bolted together so I won&amp;rsquo;t bother going into too much detail about it here. There are two graphs I wanted to talk about a bit more, which is why this post exists! I strongly recommend loading each in a new tab and zooming in to have a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mapping England&#39;s Most Common Pub Names</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After making my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/graphs/2021-03-23-pub-names/&#34;&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt; about the most common pub names in each country in Great Britain, one thing that really stood out was just how many pubs in England are called &lt;em&gt;Red Lion&lt;/em&gt;. Being from the Midlands that made a lot of sense to me, but a few people who I showed it to seemed quite surprised. That got me thinking about what kind of regional variation there is in pub names. So, why not look at the most popular pub names by county? This gives us a chance to dig into QGIS a bit, which I tend to use a lot at work for producing maps but haven&amp;rsquo;t talked about on here yet. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GitHub Actions on a Schedule</title>
      <link>https://ruszkow.ski/posts/2021-01-21-github-actions-on-a-schedule/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GitHub Actions on a few different&#xA;projects for building documentation and executables. The direct integration into&#xA;GitHub makes it a bit more convenient than Travis, and being able to use&#xA;predefined Actions makes simple processes way easier to set up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, one thing I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed until recently was that you can trigger&#xA;workflows to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events&#34;&gt;on a schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;This is an extremely powerful feature that, to me, seems under-publicised. My&#xA;first idea was that gives us the option of setting up auto-updating graphs - so&#xA;I decided to try that out with UK Covid-19 vaccination data. You can see the&#xA;results of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/graphs/2021-01-21-covid-19-vaccinations/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;but in this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to run through the (fairly straightforward) set-up I&#xA;used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the heady days of 2008, Oxford&amp;rsquo;s finest math-rock band TTNG (back then&#xA;still known as This Town Needs Guns) opened their&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/album/2217d2VN6Nn3zzU9mlApdK?si=nfr6tlwHQfKoMAmIfsSrtQ&#34;&gt;self-titled release&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;with a (fantastic) song providing a rather curious declaration -&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2g14gU0ZxGZ3Te9EjFsT25?si=efWS3BTTQziLPyavvecTcw&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;26 Is Dancier Than 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jump forward 12 years to 2020, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging around a bit in the Spotify&#xA;API to better understand what data it provides and try to find some fun things&#xA;to plot. In doing so, I spotted (geddit?) that within the object model, every&#xA;track has a series of attributes, one of which is called &lt;em&gt;danceability&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is the first part of actual development of the bot - information&#xA;on the concept and outline can be found in the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/posts/2020-04-14-albums-to-ruin-initial-concept/&#34;&gt;Initial Concept post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover the database operations required to power the&#xA;Twitter bot and keep track of what has already been posted and the queue of&#xA;albums to post. This carries on from some of the work done in&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ruszkow.ski/posts/2020-04-17-albums-to-ruin-working-with-the-spotify-api/&#34;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is done via&#xA;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications&#34;&gt;Developer Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;and is relatively straightforward. This provides us with the &lt;code&gt;Client ID&lt;/code&gt; and&#xA;&lt;code&gt;Client Secret&lt;/code&gt; keys that let us access the APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;inspiration&#34;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few posts shared around from the Instagram account&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema/&#34;&gt;colorpalette.cinema&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of a nice colour palette (indeed, a few years ago I had a&#xA;Twitter bot running that did something similar with&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/marvelcovers&#34;&gt;Marvel comics covers&lt;/a&gt;) and it got me&#xA;thinking about whether I could do something similar of my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea-and-an-initial-outline&#34;&gt;The idea, and an initial outline&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed from the post title, my plan is to make something&#xA;similar for album covers. I&amp;rsquo;m a big music dork and pleasing covers are part of&#xA;the reason why I still buy records, so this is a natural fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on in my day job recently has&#xA;involved taking over the development of a tool that implements some simple data&#xA;anonymisation. This includes the deployment of an executable that can be used by&#xA;non-technical staff, who will likely be the main users of the tool. It&amp;rsquo;s also&#xA;highly likely that all of those staff will be working on Windows PCs. As the&#xA;executable is created through PyInstaller, this means the executable needs to&#xA;be built in a Windows environment. Initially, I&amp;rsquo;d just been doing this locally&#xA;on my PC to create the executable for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Initial Set-Up of PiHole</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;pihole-set-up&#34;&gt;PiHole Set-Up&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Already had most of the things required, needed:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Micro-USB to Ethernet cable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;microSD card&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Short Ethernet cable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-the-raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Setting up the Raspberry Pi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Download Raspbian Lite image (for the time being, we only want to use&#xA;this for PiHole)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flash onto microSD with Etcher&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plug everything in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cock-up 1: Raspbian now disables SSH by default. Need to plug in a screen&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Change the default password on activating SSH (we&amp;rsquo;ll fix this later but&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s still good to get this done early)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shutdown, unplug screen etc, set up cables as actually desired and re-plug in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SSH in!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Run updates (&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade&lt;/code&gt;), reboot&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up SSH&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ cd ~&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ mkdir .ssh&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ cd .ssh&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ nano authorized_keys&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use PuTTYgen to generate keys&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cock-up 2: PuTTYgen&amp;rsquo;s default public key is in an incompatible format.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Delete first two rows and last row&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;ssh-rsa &lt;/code&gt; before the key&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Delete all carriage returns&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reboot to check it works&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove password authentication&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-pihole&#34;&gt;Installing PiHole&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Change from the default web admin password with &lt;code&gt;pihole -a -p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
