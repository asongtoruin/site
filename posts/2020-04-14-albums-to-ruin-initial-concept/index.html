    <h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve seen a few posts shared around from the Instagram account
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema/">colorpalette.cinema</a>.
I&rsquo;m a big fan of a nice colour palette (indeed, a few years ago I had a
Twitter bot running that did something similar with
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/marvelcovers">Marvel comics covers</a>) and it got me
thinking about whether I could do something similar of my own.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea-and-an-initial-outline">The idea, and an initial outline</h2>
<p>As you might have guessed from the post title, my plan is to make something
similar for album covers. I&rsquo;m a big music dork and pleasing covers are part of
the reason why I still buy records, so this is a natural fit for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far too lazy to actually manually produce posts, so it&rsquo;s going to be a bot.
It&rsquo;d be great to run this as an Instagram account, seeing as we&rsquo;ll just be
posting photos, but automating posts on there seems to be surprisingly difficult
so I guess I&rsquo;ll stick with what I know and do a Twitter bot.</p>
<p>One major part of the equation is keeping it active, so for that my plan is to
connect it up to my Spotify account via the Spotify APIs. The
<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/#endpoint-get-recently-played">Recently Played endpoint</a>
(at time of writing) gives access to up to 50 of the authenticated user&rsquo;s most
recently played tracks. As the track object includes album art, that makes life
much easier for me, as it&rsquo;s only one endpoint to access rather than needing one
to get the songs and another to get their art. Thanks, Spotify!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the question of tracking what&rsquo;s already been posted to make sure
it&rsquo;s not just posting every <em>Joyce Manor</em> album cover a hundred times, and
actually having somewhere to run the bot itself. For that I&rsquo;m planning on using
one of the numerous Raspberry Pi I have lying about the flat, with a simple
SQLite database to log albums that have already been posted.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this leaves us with four broad sections (click for links):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/posts/2020-04-17-albums-to-ruin-working-with-the-spotify-api/">Getting the recently played tracks from Spotify and link to the album art</a>;</li>
<li><a href="/posts/2020-04-20-albums-to-ruin-database-operations/">Checking against our database to see if we&rsquo;ve already enountered this album,
discarding if we have or adding it in if we have not</a>;</li>
<li>Downloading the image, getting its dominant colours and combining these in a
visually appealing way; and</li>
<li>Posting to twitter.</li>
</ol>
<p>My plan is to dedicate a post to each of these sections and ultimately end up
with a functional Twitter bot. How long will that take me? Only time will tell.</p>
