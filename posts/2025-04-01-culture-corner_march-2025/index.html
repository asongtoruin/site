<meta name="description" content="TV Severance: it took the renaming of a group chat and some substantial nagging from friends but yes, we are now fully invested in Severance. It&rsquo;s a little too stressful to completely blast through, but we got through season one at a fair pace. Lots to think about, but mainly how much I want one of the MDR keyboards.
BOOKS The Last Murder At The End Of The World by Stuart Turton: listening to this, I discovered the limit I have when it comes to the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; element of audiobooks - it&rsquo;s just a touch too theatrical for me. The book itself is OK - some good spots but also a few weird lulls.

    <h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>Severance</strong>: it took the renaming of a group chat and some substantial nagging from friends but yes, we are now fully invested in Severance. It&rsquo;s a little too stressful to completely blast through, but we got through season one at a fair pace. Lots to think about, but mainly how much I want one of the MDR keyboards.</p>
<h2 id="books">BOOKS</h2>
<p><strong>The Last Murder At The End Of The World by Stuart Turton</strong>:  listening to this, I discovered the limit I have when it comes to the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; element of audiobooks - it&rsquo;s just a touch too theatrical for me. The book itself is OK - some good spots but also a few weird lulls.</p>
<p><strong>Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky</strong>: I absolutely devoured this, another audiobook. A really cool premise (moon-sized aliens destroying planets by reshaping them into artistic forms), interesting characters and a decent pace. This basically became my background audio whenever I needed some (going for a walk, doing chores etc). Excited to listen to the rest of the series.</p>
<h2 id="games">GAMES</h2>
<p><strong>Pokémon Emerald</strong>: does it feel weird that a game I remember being released is now considered &ldquo;retro&rdquo;? Yes, yes it does. I didn&rsquo;t play this when it first came out (I was very much a Sapphire boy) so it&rsquo;s fun to take a little trip back to give it a go. Unfortunately I think I&rsquo;ve been spoiled a bit but some of the &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; improvements from a recent playthrough of Pokémon Unbound, because <em>what do you mean my bag has a size limit</em>??? I&rsquo;m still a sucker for GBA-era Pokémon though.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
<p><strong>Atkinson Hyperlegible</strong>: is this culture? I don&rsquo;t know, but also it&rsquo;s my website so I guess I can do what I want. I like a nice font from time to time, and stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a> font family while reading about some Linux stuff. It&rsquo;s a set of fonts designed to be legible and readable to people with low vision, but also it&rsquo;s just very pleasant to look at. I&rsquo;ve set it as my desktop font and my ereader font (the latter particularly useful for reading without my glasses on before bed), and I might see how this site looks with the monospace variant soon.</p>
