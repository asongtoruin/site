    <h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>I realise I&rsquo;ve basically not been doing anything with this website and that&rsquo;s a bit of a waste. That being said, I&rsquo;m not finding a huge amount of time or motivation to work on personal projects so I need to find something else to fill the space.</p>
<p>The slow death of Twitter dot com has left me with a relative lack of places to express my Thoughts on things I enjoy (or don&rsquo;t), so I think what I might try and do is some kind of monthly dump of my thoughts on stuff. Yeah, you can get some of this from Letterboxd or StoryGraph but this might be more interim thoughts (and I get to say things about music). Okay? Okay. Let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<h2 id="films">FILMS</h2>
<p><strong>Nosferatu:</strong> at my core I&rsquo;m quite cold on period or period-adjacent films, so it took a little while for Nosferatu to sink its teeth (GEDDIT) into me, but once it did I had a great time. I&rsquo;m glad we saw it in the cinema, it really helped to lean into the tension</p>
<p><strong>The Holdovers</strong>: still thinking about it. I&rsquo;m not sure how a film that is so potentially stressful manages to be so warm.  Only regret is not watching it at Christmas, but that can certainly happen next time</p>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>The Traitors</strong>: &ldquo;event TV&rdquo; might have largely been killed off by streaming, but there&rsquo;s something enjoyably nostalgic about turning up to a social event and having the &ldquo;have you seen the latest episode&rdquo; chat. Shout-out to the group chat(s) for arguably being more entertaining than the show.</p>
<p><strong>Agatha All Along</strong>: if you&rsquo;re going to make a song the central motif of your show, it does not help if I find the song deeply annoying. An average show that I&rsquo;m glad we have finished watching.</p>
<h2 id="music">MUSIC</h2>
<p><strong>I Feel Fine</strong>: <em>The Cold In Every Shelter</em> was one of my albums of the year in 2021 but eventually shuffled out of circulation. This month though, it&rsquo;s been rattling around my head and reminding me that it&rsquo;s an absolute joy.</p>
<p><strong>Origami Angel</strong>: will I finally see a gami gang headline set that isn&rsquo;t <em>acoustic</em> let&rsquo;s find out soon.</p>
<h2 id="books">BOOKS</h2>
<p><strong>Tokens by Rachel O&rsquo;Dwyer</strong>: I&rsquo;m <em>slowly</em> making my way through this, and am very much enjoying having a book that is about digital currency (ish) but also retains a lot of skepticism about cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2 id="games">GAMES</h2>
<p><strong>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</strong>: sometimes I struggle to understand why certain games grab me and others don&rsquo;t. The intangible thing that goes from a game I&rsquo;ll play for a couple of hours to one I&rsquo;ll obsess over for an extended period of time. This fits into the latter camp. There&rsquo;s just <em>so much</em> to it, I can hop on for an hour at a time and do a completely different bunch of activities. It&rsquo;s got the right amount of drama and <em>absolutely not taking itself seriously</em>. I&rsquo;ll be playing it for a while I think.</p>
