<h1 id="what">What?</h1>

<p>A calendar plot showing every gig I went to last year, including festivals.
Every orange square represents a day where I saw live music, in effect.
Mid-September to mid-December was a bit of a wild time.</p>

<h1 id="how">How?</h1>

<p>The two steps needed to produce this are almost entirely separate:</p>

<ol>
<li>Getting and processing the data</li>
<li>Producing the graph</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="getting-the-data">Getting the data</h2>

<p>Google allows you to download an ICS file of all of your calendar events via its
<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings/export">export</a> functionality.
This, however, contains <em>all</em> events from your calendar, so it needs a bit of
work. I wrote a short script to extract all of the 2019 events, and then
manually deleted rows that didn&rsquo;t relate to gigs. Is it elegant? No, but the
majority of events in my calendar are indeed gigs, so it wasn&rsquo;t too much effort.</p>

<h2 id="producing-the-graph">Producing the graph</h2>

<p><code>calmap</code> is one of my favourite libraries, but I rarely get to use it outside
work so this was more or less an excuse for me to play with it a bit and make
something that looks nice. A little rejigging was required to make sure that
multi-day events (basically just the two festivals I attend every year)
were properly represented, but otherwise this part was fairly straightforward.</p>

<h1 id="libraries-resources">Libraries / Resources</h1>

<ul>
<li><code>ics</code></li>
<li><code>calmap</code>, specifically a <a href="https://github.com/AECOM-EDB-TP/calmap">fork</a> I
generated at work, with nice dividers between the months</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/radomir-tinkov/gilroy">Gilroy</a>, a font
available for free</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h1>

<p>As previously mentioned, this relied on my Google calendar for the dates of
individual gigs, though obviously I don&rsquo;t want to share that here. Instead,
here&rsquo;s a playlist featuring one song that was played at each event, in order of
attendance.
